# Hummingbird Websocket chat 

Application demonstrating how to use web sockets. 

Run the application and then using a web browser go to `localhost:8080/chat.html`. Enter a name and start typing messages. Open another web browser page to create a second connection and chat between the two pages.

The app includes a simple connection manager for managing all the websocket connections.

Because this sample serves a web page, you will need to make sure you have set the working directory to the root folder of the example before running.
